On the upcoming versions I would like to add:
1. Documentation for engine
2. 100% test coverage for engine
3. Colors
    * UI to switch colors
        1. pick your own color
        2. rainbow color, every vertex is a different color
4. Make all shapes of same type render from one buffer(if possible)
5. Shape preview: so users can see what they are drawring as they are drawing it
6. Point size/Line thickness
7. Consider making ts matrix adaptation stand alone so others can use it
8. Add rotate camera method to renderer
