on the upcoming versions I would like to add:
1. Separate engine code into its own npm package that the drawing app requires
2. Documentation for engine
3. Colors
    * UI to switch colors
        1. pick your own color
        2. rainbow color, every vertex is a different color
    * colors apply to all other shapes
4. Make all shapes of same type render from one buffer(if possibl)
5. Shape preview: so users can see what they are doawring as they are drawing it
6. add icons for UI menu of drawing app to make it
7. Point size/Line thickness
8. Add icons for each shape/renderMode
    * change icon of main ui button to reflect the current shape/rendermode being drawn
9. Render mode menu only available when in developer mode(settings UI needed)
