on the upcoming versions I would like to add:
1. Separate engine code into its own npm package that the drawing app requires
2. Documentation for engine
3. Colors
    a. UI to switch colors
        i. buttons
        ii. pick your own color
        iii. random color every 250 milliseconds
    b. color affects render mode shapes
    c. colors apply to all other shapes
4. make all shapes of same type render from one buffer
5. Shape preview: so users can see what they are doawring as they are drawing it
6. add icons for UI menu of drawing app to make it
7. Point size/Line thickness
